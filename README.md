# Tweet-a-Watt
Fork of awesome Tweet-a-Watt project. This fork adds:
- cross platform support for opening serial ports (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
- automatically closes the serial port when the program ends
  + this was causing my computer to crash if I didn't close it correctly
- adds a `gitignore` for `*.pyc` and `csv` files
